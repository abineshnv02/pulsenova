       <div><p class="about3">Our logo embodies the essence of time's relentless passage and the ceaseless movement of the tides. At its heart, a classic sand dial stands as a timeless symbol, capturing the inexorable flow of moments slipping through the hourglass. The meticulous craftsmanship of the hourglass reflects our commitment to precision and excellence in watchmaking.

        Surrounding the sand dial, the motto "Time and Tide Wait for None" serves as a poignant reminder of the immutable nature of time. It encapsulates the philosophy that every passing second is precious and fleeting, urging us to seize each moment and make the most of it.</p></div>
